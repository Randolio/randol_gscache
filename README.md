# Randolio: G's Cache

**ESX/QB/ND supported with bridge**

A recreation of the GTA Online collectible minigame "G's Cache". If you're not familiar with it, basically a package gets spawned and stashed at a random location around the map and players are hinted with a radius blip of that area to go find it and get the reward. 

**Features**:

* All 75 locations from GTA online are availble.
* Server side spawned object, randomized location and model from the 3 possible drug package props.
* Everything synced between all players, including ones that log in after it has spawned.
* Beep sound from the coordinates of the package when a player is within 15.0 distance of the package.
* Adjustable Cycle timer so you can decide how consistent you want G's cache to drop. Default is every 90 minutes.
* All animations and audio banks used from the decomp.
* Open rewards with a pre-configured default as an example.

**Notes**:

* This requires game build 2372 (Tuners) and one sync infinity to use.
* The first package will spawn after CycleTimer minutes, from when the resource starts.
